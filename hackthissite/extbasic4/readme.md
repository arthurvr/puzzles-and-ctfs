# Extended basics 4

This time we get the following program:

```
BEGIN F.ake
var int as in
int var as in
out var int
```

The challenge also mentions that the user inputs the values 6 and 7.

What I think is happening:

1. The begin statement is not really relevant
2. 6 gets stored in the variable `var`
3. 7 gets stored in the variable `int`
4. `var int` gets outputted, being `67`.

The output is thus `67`, which is correct. Again, there are countless ways to interepret this program so it's a bit of a guessing game...
