# Basic missions: basic 6

The encryption process is quite simple:

* Convert the characters to ASCII first.
* Then it adds `0` characters to the first, `1` to the second, `2` to the third, ...
* Convert the characters back

Writing a program that does the inverse is trivial, but I did it using paper and a pencil :)
