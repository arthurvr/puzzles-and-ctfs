> Often times you will need to decipher a language which you can not find on google, or is encrypted in some way

> I have made up a language for you to decipher. What is the output of this program?

This is the given code:

```
BEGIN notr.eal
CREATE int AS 2
DESTROY int AS 0
ANS var AS Create + TO
out TO
```

The right answer is `2`. To be honest, I'm not really sure what is happening exactly. I can guess what these statements mean, but trying the immediate values in the program first seemed logical.
