# `basic-mod2`

Again, the description really told me what program I need to write:

> Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format.

See `solution.py`.
