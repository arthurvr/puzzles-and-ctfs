# morse-code

> Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this? Download the file here. Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

Just listen to the given file and [decode](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse). Or easier: there's software around that does this for you. I used [this tool](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html?utm_content=cmp-true) and got `W H 4 7     H 4 7 H    9 0 D    W 2 0 U 9 H 7`.


The flag is `picoCTF{wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7}`.
