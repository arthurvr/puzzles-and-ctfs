# Torrent analyze

> SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}. 

It's a pcap file, which I can open and analyze using Wireshark. What we're looking for is called an `info_hash`. It is used to uniquely identify a torrent. The hash that appears a lot of times in our pcap is the following one:

Which we can Google for to identify what file this is about:

The flag is:

```
picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}
```
