# basic-mod1

The description really just tells us what to do with the given `message.txt`:

> Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. `picoCTF{decrypted_message}`).

I did this using a python script, see `solution.py`.

```

└─$ python solution.py
picoCTF{r0und_n_r0und_b6b25531}
```
