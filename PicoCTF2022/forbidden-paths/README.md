# Forbidden Paths

> Can you get the flag?
> Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55827).
> We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

You can read the flag when entering the relative path: `../../../../flag.txt`.
