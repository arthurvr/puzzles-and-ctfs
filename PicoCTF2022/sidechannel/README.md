# SideChannel

> There's something fishy about this PIN-code checker, can you figure out the PIN and get the flag?

I did a time-based side channel attack. Counting the executed instructions might be a better side channel (less chance of other processes interfering) - but here time seemed to work out fine. See `solution.py` for the code.
