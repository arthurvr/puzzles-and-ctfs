# rail-fence

> A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it?

> Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, `picoCTF{decoded_message}`.

I guess it could be fun to write a rail fence cipher myself now, but in a CTF competition, knowing available tools can be a lot more valuable. I used *CyberChef*. Note that the number of rails is the "key".
