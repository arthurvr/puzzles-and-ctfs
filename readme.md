# Coding challenges, puzzles and CTFs

This are my solutions to all kinds of (online) coding challenges, puzzles and lots of CTFs. Some of these CTFs I actually participated in competitively, others I just tried after the event itself.

**Beware, spoilers**! Seriously, don't spoil the fun. Try these yourself! That being said, I did try not to publish any challenge with little solves, redacted some, and never publish anything while an event is still going on.

This repo is just a way to keep track of my own work... pull requests with changes or more solutions aren't welcome, sorry :) Feedback, thoughts or fresh ideas, however, are welcome!

I try to store all malware samples in password-protected zip files. Your anti-virus might still complain though. (And, anything is at your own risk ðŸ˜‰)
