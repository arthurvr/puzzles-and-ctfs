# Day 14: The Little Machine That Wanted to Learn

* **What is the other term given for Artificial Intelligence or the subset of AI meant to teach computers how humans think or nature works?** `machine learning`

* **What ML structure aims to mimic the process of natural selection and evolution?** `genetic algorithm`

* **What is the name of the learning style that makes use of labelled data to train an ML structure?** `supervised learning`

* **What is the name of the layer between the Input and Output layers of a Neural Network?** `hidden layer`

* **What is the name of the process used to provide feedback to the Neural Network on how close its prediction was?** `Back-Propagation`

* **What is the value of the flag you received after achieving more than 90% accuracy on your submitted predictions?** I uploaded the final script here, in `solution.py`. The flag is `THM{Neural.Networks.are.Neat!}`.
