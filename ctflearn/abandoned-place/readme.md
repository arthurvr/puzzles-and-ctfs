> the flag is outside of the pic, try to find it. another hint: dimensions, dimensions, everything is in dimensions.

The hint in the challenge is pretty clear. Right now the image appears to be `2016 x 900` but I think the true size will be bigger. 

The dimensions are `0x7E0 0x384` in hexadecimal, let's try if we can find and edit the dimensions. I used an app called `HextEdit` to add some more height. And that way, the flag appeared (see `image.jpg`)!
