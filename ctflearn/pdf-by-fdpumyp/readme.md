# PDF by fdpumyp 

> Hi, just as we talked during a break, you have this file here and check if something is wrong with it. That's the only thing we found strange with this suspect, I hope there will be a password for his external drive

Inside the pdf file there's an attached file called `.backup`. I just used the "official" Acrobat Reader to open this file. (I would've been a good idea to do this in a VM... PDF files and their attachements can be dangerous.) It contains `Q1RGbGVhcm57KV8xbDB3M3kwVW0wMG15MTIzfQ==`, the base64 encoding of the flag.
