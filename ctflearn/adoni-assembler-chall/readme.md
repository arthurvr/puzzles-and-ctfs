# Adoni Assembler Chall 

> This is an introductory Assembler programming challenge for anyone who has always wanted to begin learning 64 bit Intel Assembler. adoni.asm file provided compiles and links but does not provide the flag. You have to edit the adoni.asm file and change it to display the flag. There is a readme file with 4 videos to watch that provide enough information to add some assembler instructions to the file and compile and link and run your first Assembler program.

> Adoni is a city in India and the flag is related to the city.


I modified the asm-file by adding a `jmp` instruction to `_printflag`. See `adoni-modified.asm`.
