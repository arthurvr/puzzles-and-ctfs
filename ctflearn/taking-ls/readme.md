# Taking LS

> Just take the Ls. Check out this zip file and I be the flag will remain hidden.

There a `ThePassword.txt` in a hidden folder in the zip file -- make sure your explorer shows folders that start with a `.` character. This password can be used to open the pdf. 

The title of this challenge probably refers to the `ls -al` command to show files.
