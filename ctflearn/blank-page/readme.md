# Blank Page 

> I've just graduated the Super Agent School. This is my first day as a spy. The Master-Mind sent me the secret message, but I don't remember how to read this. Help!

This given text file is not really blank, which you can figure out using the hexdump or lots of text editors. There's both spaces in there, and some `\200f` characters. Replace the spaces by zero and the the other character by 1: you can use cyberchef to decode the binary after.
