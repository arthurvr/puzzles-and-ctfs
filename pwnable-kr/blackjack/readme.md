If you like pain, do start reading through that code. It's really bad :D

There's one thing I always check with this kind of challenges: what if we enter a negative amount of cash as bet? Turns out you can even enter $-1.000.000... If you then choose a losing strategy, -1.000.000 gets **subtracted** from your account, making you a millionaire :)
