# Introduction to CryptoHack

These challenges are pretty simple. The code (and some inline comments) should be self-explanatory.

1. *Finding Flags*: This one is easy; just copy the given flag.
2. *Great Snakes*: Run the [given Python file](great_snakes.py) to get the flag.
3. *ASCII*: Convert a given list of ASCII numbers to a string. Solved in [Solution ↗️](ascii.py).
4. *Hex*: Decode a given string in hex format. [Solution ↗️](hex.py)
5. *Base64*: Take the below hex string, decode it into bytes and then encode it into Base64. [Solution ↗️](b64.py)
6. *Bytes and Big Integers*: Use the PyCryptodome library to convert a big integer into a message. [Solution ↗️](big-integer.py)
7. *XOR Starter*: Given a string, XOR each character with the integer 13. [Solution ↗️](xor.py)
8. *XOR Properties*: Use given mathematical properties of the XOR operation to figure out some keys. [Solution ↗️](xor-properties.py)
9. *Favourite byte*: A string has been XORed with a single byte, but which one is not provided. [Solution ↗️](favourite-byte.py)
10. *You either know, XOR you don't*: The flag is encrypted with a secret key. [Solution ↗️](secret-key.py)
