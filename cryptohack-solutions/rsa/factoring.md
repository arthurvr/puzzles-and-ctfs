# Factoring

> Factorise the 150-bit number 510143758735509025530880200653196460532653147 into its two constituent primes. Give the smaller one as your answer.

I was competing with a friend here so I used the fastest method possible: I entered the number in the factordb. [Yay ↗️](http://factordb.com/index.php?query=510143758735509025530880200653196460532653147). I'd encourage anyone to actually implement an algorithm instead though :)
