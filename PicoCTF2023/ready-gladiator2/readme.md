> Can you make a CoreWars warrior that wins every single round?

I continued reading in the [CodeWar docs](https://corewars.org/docs/book1.html). I tried the first two basic warriors on that page, without success. As they're asking to win every single round, I think what I need is the *Imp Gate* (presented in subsection 3). Let's try...

Don't just copy the listed *Imp Gate* code, but notice this line too:

> The imp gate is defensive by nature, and will not win against a stationary enemy unless this enemy self-destructs.

So after copying the *Imp Gate* code, I added an `end` statement.
