> How to automate tasks to run at intervals on linux servers?


I immediately thought about [cron jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). However, `crontab -l` did not find any cron jobs... So I decided to check out the configuration file (*the cron table*) myself:

```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat /etc/crontab
# picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_0bb95b71}
```
