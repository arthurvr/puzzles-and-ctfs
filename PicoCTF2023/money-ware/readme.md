> Your friend just got hacked and has been asked to pay some bitcoins to `1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX`. He doesn’t seem to understand what is going on and asks you for advice. Can you identify what malware he’s being a victim of?

I looked the given wallet up on Google. It's used by the group behind [Petya and NotPetya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_and_NotPetya). The flag is `picoCTF{Petya}`.
