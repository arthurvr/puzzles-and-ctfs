## [Project Euler - Problem 44](https://projecteuler.net/problem=44)

> Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, `Pn = n*(3*n - 1) / 2`. It can be seen that `P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8`. However, their difference, `70 - 22 = 48` is not pentagonal.

> Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, `Pj` and `Pk` for which the sum and the difference are pentagonal and `D = abs(Pk - Pj)` is minimised; what is the value of D?
