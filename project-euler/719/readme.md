## [Project Euler - Problem 719](https://projecteuler.net/problem=719)

> We define an S-number to be a natural number, n, that is a perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of n into 2 or more numbers then adding the numbers.

> Further we define T(N) to be the sum of all S numbers n <= N. You are given T(10^4) = 41333.

> Find T(10^12).


### Running

```
$ python problem719.py
```

Just make sure that's Python 3.
