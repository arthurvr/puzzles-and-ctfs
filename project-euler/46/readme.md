## [Project Euler - Problem 46](https://projecteuler.net/problem=46)


> It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

>>  25 = 7 + 2×32

>>  27 = 19 + 2×22

>>  33 = 31 + 2×12

> It turns out that the conjecture was false. What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
