## [Project Euler - Problem 45](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45)

> Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

>> **Triangle Numbers**: Tn = n(n+1) / 2

>>> 1, 3, 6, 10, 45, ...

>> **Pentagonal Numbers**: Pn = n(3n−1) / 2

>>> 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

>> **Hexagonal Numbers**: Hn = n(2n−1)

>>> 1, 6, 45, 28, 45, ...

> It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

> Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
