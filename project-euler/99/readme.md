## [Project Euler - Problem 99](https://projecteuler.net/problem=99)


> Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.

> However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

> Using `base_exp.txt`, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.


### Running
