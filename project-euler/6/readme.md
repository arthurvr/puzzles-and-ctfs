## [Project Euler - Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)


> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

> 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385

> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025

> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
