## Solution

IDA immediately dropped us into the main procedure. Looks like one of the final comparisons is a comparison which decides wheter to show the success message. I renamed the memory locations and added some comments to make clear what is happening:

Now for the `cmp` call:

* The first argument is the memory location the user input is stored at.
* The first argument is EAX, which became `988650 - 301296 + 1702271 = 2389625`.

So `2389625` is the password.
