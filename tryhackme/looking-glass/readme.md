## Recon

The usual NMAP scan revealed a lot of open SSH ports, see `nmap.log`. Strangely,
all ports between 9000 and 13783 seem to be running an SSH service. I tried to log
in with some simple credentials, but got very weird messages in return instead:

```
┌─[parrot@parrot]─[~/Desktop/looking-glass]
└──╼ $ssh root@$IP -p 9000

```

It looks like we need to find which port to use by using these higher/lower hints...
Ideal for a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) :)
I programmed a binary search for this in `find-ssh-port.sh`. On port 12095 I found
the following:

```
┌─[parrot@parrot]─[~/Desktop/looking-glass]
└──╼ $ssh root@$IP -p 12095
You've found the real service.

## Cracking this cipher

This still seems to have the structure of an actual text, or maybe a poem? I
first assumed it was a "simple" substitution cipher, but couldn't find a key.
Then I tried a Vigenere cipher (a little more complex substitution cipher).

I didn't have a key, but luckily there are [tools](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher)
that try different keys. Turns out the key was `thealphabetcipher`. The
plaintext is the following:

```
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought--
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Your secret is bewareTheJabberwock
```

If I enter that secret in the prompt, I get the following line back:

```
jabberwock:PlatesShoutedAshesCareless
```

This is a valid login for the SSH service on port 22

## User Flag

There is a first flag in this user's home directory:

![](user-flag.png)

## Privilege escalation

It looks like we can call `reboot`, and can control the script executed by
`tweedledum` when rebooting:

![](tweedledum.png)

I used this to gain a reverse shell for `tweedledum`... horizontal escalation
for now. The `tweedledum` home directory contained the following two files:

```
$ cat humptydumpty.txt
dcfff5eb40423f055a4cd0a8d7ed39ff6cb9816868f5766b4088b9e9906961b9

$ cat poem.txt
     'Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      As black as a tar-barrel;
     Which frightened both the heroes so,
      They quite forgot their quarrel.'
```

The last line of this `humptydumpty.txt` looks a lot like ASCII... The amount of
numbers in the 60s -70s range make me suspicous. So I tried to decode it:

```
$ echo "7468652070617373776f7264206973207a797877767574737271706f6e6d6c6b" | xxd -r -p
the password is zyxwvutsrqponmlk
```

This is a valid password for the `humptydumpty` user. It also looks like I can
move to `tweedledee`:

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tweedledum on looking-glass:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User tweedledum may run the following commands on looking-glass:
    (tweedledee) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
```

## Root key

With the humptydumpty user I started investigating the `/home/alice` directory.
This had very  strange permissions set up: it was made executable but not
readable. So I could enter the directory, but could not run `ls`, for example.
However, I found an interesting file anyway:

```
humptydumpty@looking-glass:/home/alice$ cat .ssh/id_rsa
cat .ssh/id_rsa

```

I saved this as `alice-id.rsa`. There is something interesting about Alice in
her sudoers file:

```
alice@looking-glass:/etc/sudoers.d$ cat alice 
alice ssalg-gnikool = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
```

So we will be able to execute bash as root, but only from the host called
`ssalg-gnikool`. This is luckily a parameter for the sudo command: `-h` sets the
hostname.

```
alice@looking-glass:/etc/sudoers.d$ sudo -h ssalg-gnikool /bin/bash
sudo: unable to resolve host ssalg-gnikool
